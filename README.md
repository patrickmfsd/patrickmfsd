# 👨🏻‍💻 Hi   

I’m a iOS Developer and Web Developer from Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺. In 2020 I completed my Bacholor of Information Technology at RMIT University.

I have experience with Swift, Web Development, Automation (macOS Automator and Shortcuts), C, and UI Prototyping. I also play guitar, enjoy graphic design and photography and tinkering with electronics.
